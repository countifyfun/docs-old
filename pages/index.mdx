# Introduction

Countify is your dream Discord counting bot. It helps you keep your conuting channel neat and organized, whilst keeping everyone engaged and having fun.

## Features

Countify is not just your normal Discord counting bot. It also has features that make it unique.

### One-by-one

Only allow one count per user. This makes sure users don't spam to fill your counting channel.

### Reset on fail

The moment someone fails to get the count right (or fails through other ways, such as counting more than once if one-by-one is enabled), the count will immediately be reset back to 0.
